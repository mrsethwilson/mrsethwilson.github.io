              In this role, I led all aspects of sales management, team development, and sales related initiatives 
              that helped the team to exceed their individual and team targets. By leveraging data-driven strategies 
              we successfully implemented new tools, sales methodologies, and incorporated data dashboards that 
              helped our team succeed. Our team adopted Sandler sales methodologies and a new CRM platform to improve 
              lead tracking and client relationship management. These improvements and managing what we measured 
              contributed to record revenue growth. Additionally, our efforts secured record revenue with Motorola 
              Solutions with a 170% YOY increase in sales. This increase allowed Commenco to finish as a top 20 partner 
              in North America for the first time. In addition to that, by strategically restructuring the sales team 
              staff, we saw a 30% increase in overall performance since 2021. This was also achieved by developing 
              go-to-market plans for newly introduced product lines where our new processes created a 140% year-over-year 
              increase in product category sales in 2023, reinforcing Commenco’s position as a market leader.

              This position has reinforced the importance of combining data-driven insights with strong coaching 
              strategies. Guiding the team through the implementation of new processes taught me how to balance 
              big-picture thinking with day-to-day tactics, ensuring consistent growth. Watching individual team 
              members thrive and evolve under structured training has been a highlight of my career, and it continues 
              to fuel my passion for leadership and innovation.

              As Vice President of Operations at Ko Martial Arts, I managed daily processes and strategic decisions 
              to ensure the organization’s continued growth. By spearheading the development of new member sales 
              and marketing initiatives, I drove a 30% increase in gross revenue compared to the previous year. My role 
              included the oversight of a 20-member staff which required me to implement leadership strategies that 
              fostered teamwork and accountability. Being responsible for a $1.5+ million annual budget meant allocating 
              resources effectively across multiple branches to ensure financial success. Through detailed forecasting 
              and resource planning, we positioned Ko Martial Arts for future franchise expansion.

              I learned to communicate vision and expectations clearly across different teams, ensuring everyone had 
              the tools and confidence to excel. This role significantly shaped my strategic approach to business management.

              During my time as a Business Consultant at Side Kick Success, I provided strategic, hands-on guidance 
              to small business owners seeking to find a competitive edge. My primary focus involved analyzing KPI’s 
              and recommending improvements that led to average YOY revenue growth of up to 27%. I specialized in mentoring 
              martial arts school owners to restructure their teams and develop reliable training resources to scale and 
              boost their performance. Additionally, I created standardized content and tools to streamline membership and 
              customer onboarding processes. With a 100% success rate in customer satisfaction, my consulting work consistently 
              fostered measurable growth for a diverse client group.

              Consulting allowed me to dive into a wide range of business issues and discover how universal principles

              remains one of the most gratifying aspects of my professional journey.

              As President and Owner of Versus Sport Taekwondo (formerly Ko’s Black Belt Academy), I guided the business 
              through a transformational rebrand that modernized its identity and market position. My comprehensive programs 
              and marketing initiatives fueled a 300% growth in revenue, scaling from $200,000 to over $600,000 annually. The 
              company’s rise in both financial value and brand reputation eventually culminated in a successful business sale. 
              Beyond finances, I also introduced coaching methods that helped numerous elite athletes achieve success in international 
              competition.

              Owning and rebranding a business helped me learn lessons about entrepreneurship, resilience, and vision. Seeing

              to refining marketing tactics, this experience taught me that an unwavering commitment to excellence and innovation can 
              be transformational.
