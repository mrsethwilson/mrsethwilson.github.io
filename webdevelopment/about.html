                <p>
                    My name is Seth Wilson, and I am a <em>high-performance</em> coach, <em>sales leader</em>, and <em>business owner</em> from the Kansas City area. <br><br>
                    In my current role, I lead sales professionals at <strong>Commenco</strong>, a technology solutions company. Commenco specializes in safety and security solutions, however, we are most known for helping our customers solve their challenges with relentless focus and attention to detail. <br><br>
                    I am continuing to challenge myself through <em>continued education</em> as I work towards completing my MBA at the University of Missouri-Columbia, with an expected completion in 2026. <br><br>
                    My background includes a Bachelor of General Studies that focused on Business Management and Psychology curriculum, which was also achieved at the University of Missouri-Columbia. These educational experiences, combined with my time coaching elite-level athletes, 
                    <br>have helped shape me into a passionate and team-oriented leader who values collaboration and perseverance. I believe in the continued pursuit of excellence and, by leveraging my expertise in coaching and business leadership, 
                    <br>I strive to help others unlock their full potential and achieve their biggest goals.
