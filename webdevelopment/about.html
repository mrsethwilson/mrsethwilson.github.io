      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Seth Wilson, and I am a <em>high-performance</em> coach, 
        <em>sales leader</em>, and <em>business owner</em> from the Kansas City area.
      </p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        In my current role, I lead sales professionals at <strong>Commenco</strong>, 
        a technology solutions company. Commenco specializes in safety and security solutions, 
        however we are most known for helping our customers solve their challenges with relentless 
        focus and attention to detail. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am continuing to challenge myself through continued education as I work towards completing 
        my MBA at the University of Missouri-Columbia, with an expected completion in 2026. 
        My background includes a Bachelor of General Studies that focused on Business Management 
        and Psychology curriculum, which was also achieved at the University of Missouri-Columbia.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in the continued pursuit of excellence and, by leveraging my expertise in coaching 
        and business leadership, I strive to help others unlock their full potential and achieve their biggest goals.
      </p>
