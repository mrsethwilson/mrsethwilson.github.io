<body>

     My name is Seth Wilson, and I am the Director of Sales/Marketing for a technology integration company in Kansas City. I am fortunate to have experience designing and launching websites in my current and previous roles. Many years ago, I took some web development courses like this one. I hope that by the end of the semester, I will have learned new skills and be able to apply new knowledge directly to my role in overseeing our company website. 
While some may find it a little sad, my favorite hobby is working. In my free time, I spend a lot of time continuing to work! If I’m not doing that, I’m at the gym, watching the Chiefs, or continuing to learn through a constant supply of good books.
